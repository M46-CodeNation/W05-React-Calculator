# Week 05 - React Calculator Challenge

**Author:** Peter C. Matthews

This repository contains my submission for the [Master Coding](https://wearecodenation.com/2022/04/25/master-coding/) course at *CodeNation*.

## Brief

**Calculator Criteria**

 - Hold all the buttons to be displayed in an array and map through the array of buttons to generate the buttons.
 - Display the sum as you click the buttons.
 - At least be able to add, subtract, multiply, divide.
 - Have a clear button which clears the current sum.
 - When the equal button is clicked it calculates the sum you have typed and displays the answer.
 - Use the evaluate method from the Math.js library. ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjs))

**Stretch Goals (Optional)**

 - Add more math logic such as: to the power, square root, brackets, an ‘ANS’ button that uses the previous answer etc.
 - Display the answer on each button click as well as what the user has typed.
 - Add keyboard functionality so you can type a sum on your keyboard as well as click the buttons.
